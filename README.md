# Quartenary Search Tree for C++ - OOPD Assignment 3

A template-based C++ program that implements a quartenary search tree. This project was created as part of an Object-Oriented Programming and Design assignment.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the program, you will need a C++ compiler. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the code using your C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
4. Run the executable.

## Usage

The program provides a menu-based system for interacting with the quartenary search tree. You can insert books and people, delete entries, and print the tree in preorder.

- Option 1: Insert Book
- Option 2: Insert Person
- Option 3: Delete Book
- Option 4: Delete Person
- Option 5: Print Book Tree (Preorder)
- Option 6: Print Person Tree (Preorder)
- Option 7: Quit

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the program.

## Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by C++ Components and Algorithm and 
  The C++ Standard Template Library.
